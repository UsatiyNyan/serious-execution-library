# serious-execution-library

This library describes a building blocks for creating asynchronous and parallel execution.

It contains different `Signal`-s (which are also known as `Future` or `Sender`) and their parallel and sequential compositions.

`Slot`-s (also known as `Promise` or `Receiver`) are considered part of internal implementation and should not be depended on.

`Executor`-s describe how `Signal`-s are scheduled and executed. 

For the most part `monolithic_thread_pool` (or `distributed_thread_pool` when it's ready) should be used. 

Use `manual_executor` for single-threaded environment.

# Showcase

## send some work to "background"

```cpp
executor& thread_pool = ...;
schedule(thread_pool, [] -> meta::result<..., ...> { /* some work */}) 
    | and_then([]{ /* some other work via a separate step on thread_pool */ })
    | detach();

```

## map-reduce

"joke" example, since all(...) does not accept std::vector yet

```cpp
executor& thread_pool = ...;
const vector<InputT> inputs = ...;
const auto [inputs1, ...] = split(inputs);
const ReduceResultT result =
    all(
        as_signal(inputs1) | continue_on(thread_pool) | map([](vector<InputT> inputs_part) -> vector<MapResultT> { ... }),
        ...
    ) 
    | map([](tuple<vector<MapResultT>, ...> inputs_parts) {
        return reduce(inputs_parts...);
    }) 
    | get<>();
```

## coroutines

```cpp
executor& thread_pool = ...;

constexpr auto another_coro = [](Response response) -> async<Value> {
    co_return ...;
};

coro_schedule(thread_pool, [] -> async<void> {
    const auto response_result = co_await request("..."); // where request(...) -> Signal<Response, Error>
    if (!response_result.has_value()) {
        // handle Error
        co_return;
    }

    const auto value = co_await another_coro(response_result.value());
    ...
});
```

## channel/select

```cpp
executor& thread_pool = ...;

auto channel1 = make_channel<int>();
auto channel2 = make_channel<std::string>();

// ... give channels to coroutines for example
coro_schedule(thread_pool, [channel2] -> async<void> {
    co_await channel2->send("from coro");
});

const auto result = select() //
    .case_(channel1->send(42), [](meta::unit) { return std::string{"sent int 42"}; })
    .case_(channel2->receive(), [](std::string value) { return "received string: " + value; })
    .default_([](meta::unit) { return std::string{"no channel was ready"}; })
    | get<>();
const auto value = result->value();
std::cout << value << std::endl;
```

## model

Concepts for creation of asynchrony:
- `signal` produces
- `slot` consumes
- `connection` encompasses fixed state where calculation happens
- `executor` describes how calculation is scheduled, low-level

In client code you are expected to use 

```cpp
Signal<value_type, error_type> auto f();
```

as a description of the source of asynchrony.

## thread

- `detail`
  - `atomic`, `mutex`, `condition_variable` - injections for fuzz testing
  - `tagged_ptr` - tag pointers in lower bits
  - `multiword` - primitives for multiword atomic operations
- `event`-s are different types of sync primitives for one-shot calculations (use `default_event` if confused)
- `sync` - thread-synchronization primitives
- `pool/monolithic` is a simple "queue under mutex" implementation of `executor`

## algo

- `make` - the beginning of execution pipeline
  - `result` - starts asynchrony from *just* a value, the simplest entrance into `signal` monad
  - `contract` - classic pair of `future ~ eager signal` and `promise ~ slot`, is one-shot
  - `pipe` - SPSC pseudo-blocking channel, restrictive, but fast for 1-to-1 communication
- `sched` - interactions with `executor`
  - `start_on`, `continue_on` - scheduling signals
  - `inline` - immediate executor
  - `manual` - manual executor, allows to replicate races in a single thread, mainly used in tests
- `sync` - execution strategies for synchronization
  - `serial` - serial executor, wraps any other executor into single-threaded pipeline
  - `mutex` - wrapper around serial executor, has better unlock strategy (w/o thundering herd)
  - `channel`, `select` - similar to Golang's `chan` and `select` statement
- `tf/seq` - sequential transforms of `signal`-s
  - `and_then`, `or_else`, `map`, `map_error`, `flatten` - classic monadic operations
- `tf/par` - enabling parallel execution and races
  - `all`, `any` - classic monadic operations, support cancellation of abandoned `signals`
  - `fork` - replicate signal for multiple pipelines
- `tf/type` - type transformations for signals
  - `box` - type erasure, would put `signal` and `connection` state on heap
  - `query_executor` - populate pipeline context with previous `signal-s` executor, may differ from actual executor at the point of `emit`
  - `cancellable` - injects a cancellation point into pipeline, stops slot fulfillment propagation further if cancelled
- `emit` - evaluation points, where `connection` is formed or calculation is eagerly executed
  - `get` - explicitly blocks until `signal` is evaluated, should be used in synchronous code
  - `detach` - begins evaluation, but does not return value
  - `subscribe` - manual `connection` storage, needs to be manually `emit`-ted
  - `force` - is not a termination point, but begins execution eagerly
  - `share` - is a termination point, can share it's result, is one-shot

## coro

- `coroutine` basic, needs manual `resume` (can be composed, lazily constructed, eagerly awaited)
- `generator` basic, needs manual `next`
- `async` is a coroutine that supports exec integration, `async<void>` can be scheduled in `executor`, can not be manually resumed
- `async_gen` is a generator that supports `co_await`, when awaited yields next value
- `await` gives ability to `co_await Signal`
- `as_signal` transforms `async<T>` into a producer (source of asynchrony)

> _NOTE_: If you want to include a coroutine into pipeline of signals, 
there's a way to combine `as_signal`, `continue_on` and `flatten` in order to achieve that:

```cpp
async<...> coro(T x);

... 
| and_then([&](T x) { return as_signal(coro(x)) | continue_on(some_executor); }) 
| flatten() 
| ...
```


# WONTDO

- [x] get_current_executor - `with_executor` should be enough, inline_executor case is ambiguous
- [x] repeatable connection - hard to manage memory, signals should always be one-shot
