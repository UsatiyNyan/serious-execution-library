For serious programmers.

# WONTDO

- [x] get_current_executor - `with_executor` should be enough, inline_executor case is ambiguous
- [x] repeatable_connection - `(args) -> signal` is basically a repeatable connection

# TODO

- [ ] fix box
- [ ] require noexcept from all slot-s
- [ ] thread::pool::distributed
- [ ] TESTS
- [ ] pseudo-atomics, parametrize emits and executors with atomic
